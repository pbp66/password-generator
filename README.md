# Password Generator

## Description
User Story: As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria, so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

Acceptance Criteria: When I need a new and secure password, I click the button to generate a password and I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. When prompted for password criteria, I select which criteria to include in the password. When prompted for the length of the password, I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. When asked for character types to include in the password, I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. When I answer each prompt, my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected. When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. When the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
